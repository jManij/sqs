## Lab 36: Message Queues
- 3 Standard Queues (QueueA, QueueB, QueueC) are implemented.
- The messages could be sent via command-line

  * [Test](https://github.com/jManij/sqs/blob/master/src/test/java/sqs/AppTest.java)


## Learning Objectives
To understand how message queues work.


## How to Test

* Main Point
  * Insertion sort is the most basic, off-the-shelve sorting algorithm.

* Another main point
  * It is useful with small data set and less complex than other algorithms.

## Algorithm
The algorithm is less efficient than other sorting algorithms such as quiksort, heapsort, etc since it goes through each element to find the right spot. That is O(n^2). Even if the array is sorted, the algorithm goes through each elements and puts it back to the same place. When people manually sort playing cards, most use a method similar to insertion sort.
